### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a secound year MSc Computer Sciene student at UNIPD (University of Padua), I am expected to graduate in summer 2024.

I'm currently working on a [project](https://github.com/marcohoucheng/Gran-Turismo-7-Price-Tracker) updating the daily shops in game, alone with my university exams and thesis work.

In the coming months, I will also start making my university work public as well as uploading everything else that I am working on.

Marco
